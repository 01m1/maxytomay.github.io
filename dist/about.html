              Hey! I'm Maxyto (well that's my name I go by online), I am currently 15, I am a keen programmer, web developer and hacker. I have always loved technology ever since I was young. I find coding very fun and challenging, I have been coding since I was 7 but I only started to take it more seriously since I was about 12. I have been learning ethical hacking since I was 14, I find this quite hard aswell but also enjoyable! I am always looking for ways to get better with technology, I have achieved a lot and have received certificates in the past. Not gonna show them on here but what you can see are some of my projects in the My Work section.

            <p>
              HTML was one of the first languages I learned (dont really want to refer to it as a programming language). It is used to create websites, including this one! Along with HTML, I used SASS and JavaScript. SASS is basically CSS with some extensions and JavaScript I used for some random stuff like the menu. Think of it like a human body, HTML is the actual body, CSS (or SASS in my case) is the clothing and JavaScript is the human functioning. I have also created a few sites in the past and have competed in competitions and earned certificates.

            <p>
              I have done a lot of programming in the past. I am currently trying to focus on Python just because of the many things it is capable of. I have learned Python, Java and Javascript. I have touched a bit of SQL, C++, C, PHP and Lua. In the future I am planning to get better at C++, improve my Javascript frontend skills as I mostly do Javscript backend and get better at PHP. I do want to try to learn more languages than this but these are just some I want to focus on for now. Some of my programming projects can be found in the My Work section.

            <p>
              Hacking is the most recent hobby I have started and I love it. I actually like this so much that I am considering having a job to do with cybersecurity when I'm older, probably a Penetration Tester. Some of you reading this might think hacking is illegal however this is not always the case. The type of hacking I want to do is hacking with permission, this is done in order to find vulnerabilities for something like a companies systems for example, this job has very good pay, this is not the only job in cybersecurity but is the one I want to do.
